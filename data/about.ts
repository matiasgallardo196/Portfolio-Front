  biography: `I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with a strong Back-End orientation, passionate about building scalable systems and delivering real-world solutions with measurable impact. I graduated from Henry's intensive bootcamp and hold a Technical Analyst degree in Information Systems from UTN FRT.

I specialize in modern technologies and follow best practices in validation, testing, and secure access control through RESTful APIs. My experience includes multi-tenant platforms, Stripe integrations, GitHub Actions, and cloud deployment across various platforms.

I'm passionate about clean architecture, automation, and creating solutions that make a real difference. When I'm not coding, I enjoy contributing to the developer community and staying updated with the latest technologies.`,
